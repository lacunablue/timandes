Extremely basic website to familiarize myself with GitHub and practice HTML/CSS/JS. Goal is to eventually convert into presentable portfolio style website to display my coding projects and other creative hobbies.

Planned updates:
- Adjust for better full-page look on larger screens
- improve hamburger menu

- to Work: Add quote generator, 2-3 JS GenArt projects, Python FI/RE calc program project
- to Play: Add photo gallery, sketches gallery
- to Blog: Create blog articles based off of excerpts from coding self-study journal.
- to Contact: Contact page details
